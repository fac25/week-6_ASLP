# Planty

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

##Setup

Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

Clone this repo and cd into the directory

Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies

Run `npm run` dev to start the server.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This uses the nodemon library to auto-restart the server when you save changes.

we used vite to setup the project

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
